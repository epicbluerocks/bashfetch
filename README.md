# bashfetch
A bash system information tool for Linux distros.
# How to install?
Since this uses a .deb package you will need to do these steps:
installing the file will need to change to its directory (bash) $ **cd /path/to/debfile/**
Now the point where we truely install it! (bash) **sudo dpkg -i bashfetch-VERSION.deb**
## This is all for the installation.
